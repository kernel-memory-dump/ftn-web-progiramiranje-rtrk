			<strong class="boldeded">Pollock, Jackson</strong> (1912-56).
			American painter, the commanding figure of the Abstract Expressionist
			movement. He began to study painting in 1929 at the Art Students'
			League, New York, under the Regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton.
			During the 1930s he worked in the manner of the Regionalists, being
			influenced also by the Mexican muralist painters (Orozco, Rivera,
			Siqueiros) and by certain aspects of Surrealism. From 1938 to 1942 he
			worked for the Federal Art Project. By the mid 1940s he was painting
			in a completely abstract manner, and the `drip and splash' style for
			which he is best known emerged with some abruptness in 1947. Instead
			of using the traditional easel he affixed his canvas to the floor or
			the wall and poured and dripped his paint from a can; instead of
			using brushes he manipulated it with `sticks, trowels or knives' (to
			use his own words), sometimes obtaining a heavy impasto by an
			admixture of `sand, broken glass or other foreign matter'. This
			manner of Action painting had in common with Surrealist theories of
			automatism that it was supposed by artists and critics alike to
			result in a direct expression or revelation of the unconscious moods
			of the artist.
		</p>
		<p>Pollock's name is also associated with the introduction of the
			All-over style of painting which avoids any points of emphasis or
			identifiable parts within the whole canvas and therefore abandons the
			traditional idea of composition in terms of relations among parts.
			The design of his painting had no relation to the shape or size of
			the canvas -- indeed in the finished work the canvas was sometimes
			docked or trimmed to suit the image. All these characteristics were
			important for the new American painting which matured in the late
			1940s and early 1950s.</p>
